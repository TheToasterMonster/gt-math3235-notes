\section{Other Types of Random Variables}
\begin{remark}
  Random variables may be neither discrete nor
  continuous. Let $X \sim \Exp(1)$ with
  \[
    f_X(x)
    \begin{cases}
      e^{-x} & \text{if $x > 0$}, \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    F_X(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if $x \leq 0$}, \\
      1 - e^{-x} & \text{if $x > 0$}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Let $Y$ be a discrete random variable, say
  given by
  \[
    \PP(Y = k) = 2^{k - 1}, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots.
  \]
  Define
  \[
    F(x) = \frac{1}{2} F_Y(x) + \frac{1}{2} F_X(x)
    = \frac{1}{2} F_Y(x) + \frac{1}{2}(1 - e^{-x}).
  \]
  One can show that
  $F$ is increasing, $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1$,
  $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0$, and $F$ is
  right-continuoous, so $F$ is a distribution function.
  But $F$ is not a step function or continuous, so
  the random variable with distribution function
  $F$ is neither discrete nor continuous.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  In general, there is another type of random
  variable called a \emph{singular random variable},
  which has zero density almost everywhere but is
  not constant. One can show that every random
  variable $X$ can be uniquely decomposed as
  \[
    X = X_{\text{disc}} + X_{\text{cont}} + X_{\text{sing}},
  \]
  where $X_{\text{disc}}$ is discrete, $X_{\text{cont}}$,
  is absolutely continuous, and
  $X_{\text{sing}}$ is singular continuous.
\end{remark}
