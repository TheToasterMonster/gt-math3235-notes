\section{Decomposition of Random Variables}
\begin{remark}
  Recall that there are random variables
  which are neither discrete nor absolutely
  continuous.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
  Any cdf $F$ is the convex combination of
  three cdfs, i.e.
  \[
    F = \alpha_1 F_1 + \alpha_2 F_2 + \alpha_3 F_3,
  \]
  where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 \ge 0$
  and $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 = 1$, and
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $F_1$ is a step function,
    \item $F_2$ is the cdf of an absolutely
      continuous random variable, i.e.
      \[
        F_2(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt
      \]
      where $f$ is a density,
    \item and $F_3$ is a non-constant continuous
      function which has $F_3'(x) = 0$ almost
      everywhere on $\R$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  Distribution functions of the last type $F_3$
  are said to be \emph{singular continuous}.
  The \emph{Cantor-Lebesgue function} is an example of
  such a singular continuous function.
\end{remark}
